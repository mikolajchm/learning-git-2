        <h1>Lady Gaga - Shallow and ME</h1>
        <p>Tell me something, girl and boys
            Are you happy in this modern world?
            Or do you need more?
            Is there something else you're searchin' for??
            I'm falling
            In all the good times, I find myself longin' for change
            And in the bad times, I fear myself
            Tell me something, boy
            Aren't you tired trying to fill that void?
            Or do you need more?
            Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?
            I'm falling
            In all the good times, I find myself longing for change
            And in the bad times, I fear myself
            I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
            I'll never meet the ground
            Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
            We're far from the shallow now
            In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
            In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow
            In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
            We're far from the shallow now, now
